SaaS Glossary
=============

A simple single-page Bootstrap implementation of a glossary for SaaS terminology.

## Future Plans

* Extract glossary data to a JSON file that can be edited by anyone.
* Extract a general-purpose glossary application.
* Provide on-page search capabilities.
* Enable quick links to any letter in order to minimize scrolling.

## Contributing to the Glossary

There are three ways to contribute new or modified definitions to the glossary:

1. Submit a Pull Request that incorporates the changes you'd like to see.
2. Submit an Issue to the project on GitHub.
3. Send an email to chris@chriskottom.com.

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
